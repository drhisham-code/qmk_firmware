# This is the default keymap for the Ploopy Corporation QMK Mouse. 

This mouse has 8 buttons and a scroll wheel. Aside from left/right click, there are "far-left" and "far-right" buttons, a "DPI" button, two side buttons and a scroll wheel click. These buttons can all be configured via keymap.c.

By default, most of the buttons do what you'd expect. However, this mouse has several extra buttons. Since it's expected that most people will want their own configurations, the mouse comes by default with settings that demonstrate functionality:

- The "far-left" and "far-right" have been configured, respectively as CTRL-C and CTRL-V, which is copy and paste for most platforms/applications. 
- The side buttons are configured for forward/backward navigation (buttons 4 and 5 on most mice).
- The "DPI" button is CTRL-Z, which is "undo" in many applications.
